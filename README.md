## Description 🏁

Mashiro is a simple drawing software aimed to be like a sketch book. Using an infinite canvas and opening really fast with access only to a pen and an eraser. No Ctrl-Z.

Mashiro is born because I rely too much on the speed of the Ctrl-Z to draw. If it is not responsiv I quit. So do remedy this let's learn to draw with only the minimal amount of features to really train my mind on the drawing rather than the workflow.
